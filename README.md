# Project Description

## Overview
This project is a user-friendly food ordering and management system built to make things simple and efficient for both customers and administrators. It offers a smooth experience with easy navigation, useful features, and everything needed to handle orders and system management effectively.

## Key Features

### For Customers:
1. **Easy Navigation**: Customers can quickly access Home, Services, Chefs, and Contact sections from the main page.
2. **Food Categories**: Products are organized into categories. Customers can filter by category, search for specific items, or sort by price to find what they need easily.
3. **Shopping Cart**: Adding items to the cart is simple. The cart count updates automatically, and customers can update or remove items before checking out.
4. **Login System**: If customers aren’t logged in, they’ll be redirected to the login page when they try to add items to the cart. Once logged in, they can continue with their orders.
5. **Checkout Process**: Customers can view their cart, make changes, and proceed to checkout. A confirmation page ensures everything is clear.
6. **Order History**: Customers can see all their past orders in one place.
7. **Account Updates**: Customers can easily update their account details whenever needed.

### For Admins:
1. **Admin Login**: Admins use a special email and password to access the admin side. This keeps it secure and separate from customer access.
2. **Manage Categories**: Admins can add new categories, update existing ones, or delete categories to keep the system organized.
3. **User Management**: Admins can view user details (excluding passwords), activate or deactivate accounts, and control who can log in.
4. **Order Overview**: All customer orders are visible to admins, making it easy to track and manage them.
5. **Product Management**: Admins can add new products, edit details, or remove items as needed.
6. **Simple Navigation**: The admin side includes a navigation bar for quick access to users, orders, and products.

## Why This Project Stands Out
- **Customer Convenience**: It’s designed to make ordering food fast, simple, and enjoyable for customers.
- **Admin Tools**: Admins get full control over categories, products, orders, and user accounts, all in one place.
- **Smooth Operations**: From logging in to checking out, everything works seamlessly to ensure a great experience.

## Conclusion
This project is built to connect customers and admins in a way that’s both practical and efficient. Whether it’s ordering food or managing the system, it’s all designed to be as straightforward and user-friendly as possible.
